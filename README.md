### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Thura Aung - an undergrad student and a ml engineer 

My interests revolve around nautral language processing, computer vision, and AI ethics. I occasionally blog about my personal projects and use my Github to repo them. Check out my articles on Medium.

I mainly code in Python 🐍
