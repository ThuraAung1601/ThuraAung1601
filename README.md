### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Thura Aung - an undergrad student and a ml engineer.

My interests revolve around nautral language processing, computer vision, and AI ethics. I occasionally blog about my personal projects and use my Github to repo them. 
<br/>
In leisures, I usually write blogs about Algorithms, Approaches and Applications of AI, in Burmese Language.
<br />
Check out my articles on [Medium](thuraaung-ai.medium.com)

I mainly code in Python 🐍
<br />
Apart from Python, some of the programming languages I mainly use are C++ and Java.
<br />
You can contact me via thuraaung.ai.mdy@gmail.com and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thura-aung)

I speak Burmese and English.
